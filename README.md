# leetcodes
Solutions to programming problems.

## usage
* Clone this repo
* Add your solution to the 150 folder.
* There will be a shared notion document. Update [this](https://www.notion.so/marcbeep/leetcodes-17bf3b51759280dbbf53d64f9f219819?pvs=4).
* Code feedback shall go in the notion document.
* All code must be written in Python.
* Use the naming format "[leetcodenumber]-[problemname]". For example: 88-merge-sorted-array.
* Aim to keep commit messages aligned with the problem name.

## process
* Each group member will do a leetcode in front the others reading, coding and explaining in real time for a maximum of 20 mins. This simulates articulating a never before seen problem in front of others.
* The next 10 minutes will be spent discussing feedback.
* The process repeats until all members go at least once.
